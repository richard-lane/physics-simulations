Springs
====

Some physics simulations of masses on springs; useful for first/second year mechanics, or for computational physics.

Intention
----
I should probably flesh this out a bit more, but basically this is intended to be a bridge between the good physics + bad programming that physics undergraduates learn, and the overabstract hyperfocus on "best practices" that seems to happen whenever physicists try to "do it right".

The goal should be to program well with an open mind - but not so far that your brains fall out

Contents
----
(will add hyperlinks to these when they're done)
 - [Simple oscillations](./Simple.ipynb)
 - [Two Masses and Beats](./Two.ipynb)
 - [Driven and Damped Oscillations](./Driven.ipynb)
 - Three masses
 - More masses
 - 2 dimensions
 - The continuous limit
 
 Requirements
 ----
Probably just use a sensible python distribution - anaconda?

 * python 3- maybe 3.9 or something?
 * matplotlib
 * numpy
 * pyaudio
 * more
