Collisions
==========
Relativistic collisions                                                [ ]
Balls bounce off each other                                            [x]
Balls only check neighbours for collisions                             [ ]
Physically accurate wall bouncing                                      [ ]
Collision with wall corner                                             [ ]
In principle we only need to check balls near the edges for collisions [ ]
Wall bounce code should check + process seperately                     [ ]
Make balls now slow down                                               [ ]

Process break properly
 - Will need to actually think of an algorithm                         [ ]

Graphics
========
Draw pool table                                               [x]
Draw balls on table                                           [x]
Don't redraw the table every frame, use an image or something [ ]
Draw coloured balls, start in the right place

Testing
=======
Wall bounce UT [ ]
Ball bounce UT [x]

Balls
=====
Keep track of how many balls are moving          [ ]
Reorder lists of data to have moving balls first [ ]
