Collisions
==========
Relativistic collisions                                                [ ]
Balls bounce off each other                                            [x]
Balls only check neighbours for collisions                             [ ]
Physically accurate wall bouncing                                      [ ]
Collision with wall corner                                             [ ]
In principle we only need to check balls near the edges for collisions [ ]
Wall bounce code should check + process seperately                     [ ]
Make balls now slow down                                               [ ]

Ball bounce UT [ ]

Balls
=====
Keep track of how many balls are moving          [ ]
Reorder lists of data to have moving balls first [ ]
