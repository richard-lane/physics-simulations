Collisions
==========
Relativistic collisions                                                                 [ ]
Balls bounce off each other                                                             [x]
Balls only check neighbours for collisions                                              [ ]
Physically accurate wall bouncing; should reverse the step until we're just touching    [ ]
Collision with wall corner                                                              [x]
In principle we only need to check balls near the edges for collisions                  [ ]
Wall bounce code should check + process seperately                                      [ ]
Make balls now slow down                                                                [ ]

Process break properly
 - Will need to actually think of an algorithm                         [ ]
   - Need to consider propagating collisions between touching balls

Graphics
========
Draw pool table                                               [x]
Draw balls on table                                           [x]
Don't redraw the table every frame, use an image or something [ ]
Draw coloured balls, start in the right place

Testing
=======
Wall bounce UT [ ]
Ball bounce UT [x]

Balls
=====
Keep track of how many balls are moving          [ ]
Reorder lists of data to have moving balls first [ ]
